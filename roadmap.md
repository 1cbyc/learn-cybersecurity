# Cyber Security Learning Roadmap

Welcome to the Cybersecurity Learning Roadmap! üöÄ 

I would like to update all information about my cybersecurity learning roadmap that would work for you on this **roadmap.md** file. I would also break down key milestones, topics, and skills here for ease of learning. I recall one of my interns had a hard time even with explanations, and wanted somewhere to revert to every time.

This roadmap is the initial draft designed to provide a structured path for learners to develop their skills in cybersecurity. Whether you're a beginner or looking to enhance your knowledge, follow these milestones to become a proficient cybersecurity enthusiast. I would still work on this to improve it greatly as I see fit. I intend to commit the next few months to working on this [learn cyber security community](https://github.com/1cbyc/learn-cybersecurity)  and my [vulnerability assessment platform](https://nidful.com)
